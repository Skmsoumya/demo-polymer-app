# demo-polymer-app
A demo polymer app.


#Dependencies
To use the app you need to have the following installed:

1.Node & NPM:

   Install it form http://www.nodejs.org


2.Bower:

   Install it by after installing nodejs by running npm install bower -g

3.Any simple HTTP server:

   I was using pythons SimpleHTTPServer to serve my files. If you do not have python installed in your system please use any other HTTP server that you are familiar with to serve all the files in the projects directory. You can use WAMPServer, XAMPserver or get hacky and create your own server using nodejs. 

# How to run the app

To run the app carry out the following steps:

1. Open your comand line tool/terminal and CD into the apps directory.
2. Type in `bower install` in the command line tool and press install. All the required bower components will be installed.
3. Serve the files using a HTTP server of your choice.
4. Visit to the page your files are served. It would be something like `localhost:8000` or `localhost\demo` in your browser window. Find out your url form the server of your choice.
5. Enjoy the Project :-)
